### Work Log

Week 2: This week I plan to refine some functionality I implemented last week, in particular parts
of the UI need to be cleaned up and made more responsive to user input. I then plan to shift to
implementing parts of the board settings page.

Week 1:
This week I focused on learning the tools I will be using for the project. I have not worked with
React or Firebase before, so there was a lot to become familiar with. Once I had a decent grasp
of these, I started working on interface design for various parts of the application, as well as 
research into testing frameworks.
