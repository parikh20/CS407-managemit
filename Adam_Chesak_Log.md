### Work Log

#### Week 5:
This week I will work on my first two user stories for sprint 2 - task comments and transferring
board ownership. I will also keep looking at testing frameworks and if possible start automated
testing.

##### Week 4:
This week I will work on adding the checklist to the add and view task dialogs, and implementing
the calls to make that functional. I will also work on UI polish where required.

##### Week 3:
This week I will work on implementing the ability to view and delete tasks. I also plan to work
on some UI refinements, and if possible begin work on automated testing.

##### Week 2:
This week I plan to refine some functionality I implemented last week, in particular parts
of the UI need to be cleaned up and made more responsive to user input. I then plan to shift to
implementing parts of the board settings page. I also worked on column functionality, adding the
ability to add, rename, and delete columns.

#### Week 1:
This week I focused on learning the tools I will be using for the project. I have not worked with
React or Firebase before, so there was a lot to become familiar with. Once I had a decent grasp
of these, I started working on interface design for various parts of the application, as well as 
research into testing frameworks.
